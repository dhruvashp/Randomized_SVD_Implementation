HW3_1

For c = 100, r = 10, and only a single loop

Errors in U and V as defined are obtained around 0.015-0.018

(File can be run to check this)

Thus, we can start from c = 300 and move down to c = 10 in some appropriate steps
to ensure error is 0.01,0.05 and 0.1

Obviously error reduces as c increases, and the test case surely gave us quite a 
few insights into workings of SVD
