# Randomized_SVD_Implementation

The above set of codes performs Randomized SVD on extra-ordinarily large matrices from scratch. The implementational details are explained in the code itself, along with multiple readme texts. 

The coding was done as part of the course EE546 Mathematics of High Dimensional Data taken under Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi in Fall 2020, and the codes were uploaded to public repositories around Spring 2021
